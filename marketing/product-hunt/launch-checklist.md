# Product Hunt Launch Checklist

This checklist outlines key steps and best practices for a successful Product Hunt launch.

## Pre-Launch (2-4 Weeks Before)

*   **Product Hunt Profile:** Ensure your personal and product profiles are complete.
*   **Community Engagement:** Actively upvote and comment on other products to build credibility.
*   **Launch Assets:** Prepare all visuals (screenshots, GIFs, videos) and compelling copy (tagline, description).
*   **Landing Page:** Design a dedicated landing page optimized for Product Hunt traffic with a clear CTA.
*   **Identify Supporters:** Create a list of early users, friends, colleagues, and influencers who can genuinely support your launch.
*   **Draft Marketing Materials:** Prepare email templates, social media posts, and messages for various platforms.
*   **Hunter Selection:** Decide if you will launch as a maker or work with a well-known hunter for increased visibility.

## Launch Day

*   **Timing:** Launch at 12:01 AM PT on a Tuesday or Wednesday for maximum visibility throughout the day.
*   **Post Your Product:**
    *   Upload all assets (images, GIFs, videos).
    *   Write a compelling, concise tagline.
    *   Include the authentic Maker's Comment, sharing your story and vision.
*   **Promote & Share (Legitimately):**
    *   Share your Product Hunt link on social media platforms (LinkedIn, Twitter, Reddit), email lists, Slack communities, and relevant forums.
    *   **Crucially, DO NOT directly ask for upvotes.** Instead, ask for feedback, support, or to check out your launch. For example: "We just launched on Product Hunt! Check it out and let us know what you think!"
    *   Engage with your early supporters and community.
*   **Engage Actively:**
    *   Monitor comments and questions on your Product Hunt page throughout the day.
    *   Respond promptly and authentically to all feedback, positive or negative.
    *   Share milestones (e.g., "Top 10 today!") on social media.
*   **Team Coordination:** If you have a team, create a "shift plan" for who will monitor and engage at different times.

## Post-Launch

*   **Thank Supporters:** Express gratitude to everyone who engaged with your launch.
*   **Analyze Results:** Review traffic, sign-ups, and feedback to measure your success against your goals.
*   **Follow Up:** Continue to respond to any lingering comments or questions.
*   **Repurpose Content:** Use your launch assets and insights in future marketing efforts.

## Social Media Announcement Templates (Examples)

*   **Twitter/X:** "Exciting news! We just launched LaunchAgent on Product Hunt 🎉 Bring your #AI agents to life without the #DevOps hassle. Check us out and share your thoughts! [Product Hunt Link] #OpenClaw #ManagedAI"
*   **LinkedIn:** "Thrilled to announce the launch of LaunchAgent on Product Hunt! We're making managed OpenClaw hosting simple and affordable for founders and small businesses. Say goodbye to server stress and hello to powerful AI agents. Your feedback is invaluable – take a look! [Product Hunt Link] #ProductLaunch #AIagents #Startup"

## Who to Notify

*   **Your team and colleagues.**
*   **Early users and beta testers.**
*   **Friends and family (who genuinely support your work).**
*   **Influencers or mentors** you've engaged with who might genuinely be interested.
*   **Relevant communities** (Slack, Discord, Reddit, forums) where your product solves a problem, but *always follow community rules* and focus on sharing, not spamming for upvotes.
*   **Your existing email list.**
