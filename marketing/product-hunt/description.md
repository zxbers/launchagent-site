LaunchAgent provides managed OpenClaw hosting, making advanced AI agents accessible to everyone. We take care of all the complex DevOps: deployment, continuous updates, robust monitoring, SSL certificate management, and reliable daily backups. This means you can focus on leveraging AI without worrying about server maintenance or technical overhead.

LaunchAgent is ideal for non-technical founders, small businesses, and solopreneurs who want to harness the power of AI agents but lack the time or expertise to manage their own infrastructure.

What makes us different? We're built on the open-source OpenClaw framework, ensuring you're not locked into a proprietary "walled garden." You maintain full ownership and control of your data. Get started risk-free with a 7-day free trial. After that, it's a flat $29/month. Experience true AI agent freedom.
