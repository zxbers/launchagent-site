Hey Product Hunt! I'm Zach, the maker behind LaunchAgent. I built this because I was genuinely tired of helping friends and fellow founders manually set up OpenClaw. It's an incredible open-source platform, but the deployment and management can be a real headache.

LaunchAgent solves that by offering managed OpenClaw hosting for just $29/month. No more server worries, no complex configurations – just your AI agent, ready to go. We handle the dirty work so you can focus on building. We're proud to support the open-source community.

What are you most excited to build with an AI agent?
