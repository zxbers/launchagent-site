# Indie Hackers Launch Post

## Title

**I'm charging $29/mo to host AI agents people could self-host for free. Here's why it's working.**

## Body

Hey IH 👋

I just launched **LaunchAgent** — managed hosting for OpenClaw, an open-source AI agent framework.

### What it does

You sign up, connect your Telegram/Discord/Slack/WhatsApp, and within minutes you have a personal AI agent that can:

- Search the web and control a browser
- Run scheduled tasks (cron jobs)
- Remember things across conversations
- Manage files, take notes, do research

It's a full OpenClaw instance — same thing you'd get if you cloned the repo and set it up yourself. I just remove the "set it up yourself" part.

### The backstory

I've been running OpenClaw for myself for a while and it's genuinely useful — it's like having a technical assistant in my pocket. But every time I showed it to a founder friend, the conversation went:

> "This is awesome. How do I set it up?"
> "Well, you need a VPS, Docker, a reverse proxy, DNS—"
> "Never mind."

That conversation happened enough times that I realized the product wasn't the agent — it was the hosting.

### Why $29/mo

I looked at what people pay for similar tools (Notion AI, various agent builders) and $29 felt right for a full-featured AI agent. The economics work because:

- You bring your own LLM API key (I'm not marking up tokens)
- OpenClaw is lightweight — hosting costs per instance are low
- No per-seat pricing — use it for your whole small team

There's a 7-day free trial so people can kick the tires.

### The open-source bet

Here's the part that makes some people skeptical: the thing I'm hosting is free and open-source. Anyone *can* self-host it.

But I think that's actually the moat. There's no lock-in, which means people stay because the service is good, not because they're trapped. And the open-source community keeps improving the core product.

I'm betting that convenience and reliability are worth $29/mo to people who have better things to do than babysit a Docker container.

### Where I'm at

- Just launched
- Goal: 50 paying customers ($1,450 MRR) in 90 days
- Solo founder, bootstrapped
- All revenue from subscriptions — no funding, no ads

Would love feedback on the positioning, pricing, or anything else. And if you're running a personal AI agent setup already, I'd love to hear what your stack looks like.
