**Show HN: LaunchAgent – Managed hosting for OpenClaw AI agents ($29/mo)**

## Body

I built LaunchAgent because I kept seeing the same problem: people want a personal AI agent connected to their messaging apps, but the self-hosting barrier kills most attempts before they start.

LaunchAgent deploys a full OpenClaw instance for you — OpenClaw is an open-source AI agent framework that connects to Telegram, Discord, Slack, and WhatsApp. Each instance gets:

- Web search and browser control
- Cron jobs (scheduled tasks)
- Persistent memory and file management
- Full tool access — not a restricted subset

**What this is NOT:** It's not another chatbot wrapper or thin UI on top of an API. You get an actual OpenClaw deployment. Same config, same capabilities, same code as self-hosting. We just handle the infrastructure — updates, uptime, backups.

**Open-source angle:** OpenClaw is fully open-source. If you outgrow us or want to migrate, you take your config and spin it up yourself. No proprietary formats, no export fees, no lock-in. We compete on convenience, not captivity.

**Pricing:** $29/mo flat. 7-day free trial. No per-message fees, no seat-based pricing. You bring your own LLM API key (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.) so we're not marking up token costs.

I'm a solo founder and this is early — happy to answer questions about the architecture, self-hosting tradeoffs, or why I think managed open-source is underpriced.
