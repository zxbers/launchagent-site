                <p>You've built an AI agent that works beautifully on your laptop. It responds to messages, uses tools, remembers context. There's just one problem: the moment you close your laptop lid, it dies.</p>

                <p>Running an AI agent reliably around the clock is a fundamentally different problem from building one that works in development. It's the difference between cooking a great meal at home and running a restaurant. The core skill matters, but the operational complexity is what kills you.</p>

                <p>This guide covers everything you need to know about keeping AI agents alive 24/7 — the infrastructure, the gotchas, and the honest tradeoffs between doing it yourself and using a <a href="/blog/posts/managed-vs-diy-ai-agents/">managed service</a>.</p>

                <h2 id="why-247">Why AI Agents Need to Run 24/7</h2>

                <p>The entire value proposition of an AI agent — as opposed to a chatbot you invoke manually — is that it's <strong>always available</strong>. Your customers don't send messages on your schedule. Your monitoring alerts don't wait for business hours. The automations you've built only work if the agent is there to execute them.</p>

                <p>Consider the use cases that make agents valuable:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Customer support agents</strong> — Customers expect instant responses. A 3-minute outage at 2 AM means a frustrated customer who churns silently.</li>
                    <li><strong>Sales automation agents</strong> — Leads come in from every timezone. An agent that's offline when a prospect reaches out is a lead that goes cold.</li>
                    <li><strong>DevOps/monitoring agents</strong> — The whole point is catching problems when humans are asleep. An agent that crashes at 3 AM defeats the purpose.</li>
                    <li><strong>Multi-channel communication agents</strong> — Running on Telegram, Discord, Slack, or WhatsApp simultaneously means any downtime is visible across every channel.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>The bottom line: if your agent isn't running, it isn't useful. And "mostly running" isn't good enough when your users expect instant responses.</p>

                <h2 id="challenges">The 5 Biggest Challenges of Always-On Agents</h2>

                <p>After running AI agents in production for months, here are the failure modes that actually bite you:</p>

                <h3>1. Process Crashes</h3>

                <p>AI agents are long-running processes that make network calls to LLM APIs, tool APIs, and messaging platforms. Any of these calls can fail, and failure handling in a long-lived process is hard. An unhandled exception at 4 AM takes your agent offline until someone notices.</p>

                <h3>2. Memory Leaks</h3>

                <p>Agents accumulate context over time. Without proper garbage collection and context windowing, your agent's memory footprint grows until the OOM killer takes it out. This typically happens after 12-48 hours of operation — exactly long enough that you think it's stable.</p>

                <h3>3. API Rate Limits and Failures</h3>

                <p>LLM providers have rate limits. When you hit them (especially with Anthropic or OpenAI during peak hours), your agent needs to back off gracefully rather than crash. Most agent frameworks handle the happy path; few handle the "Claude returns a 529 for the 5th time" path.</p>

                <h3>4. State Loss</h3>

                <p>When your agent process restarts, what happens to the conversation it was having? The tasks it was tracking? The files it was working on? Without persistent storage, every restart is amnesia. Your agent wakes up with no idea what it was doing.</p>

                <h3>5. Networking and Connectivity</h3>

                <p>Messaging platforms use webhooks or long-polling connections. These connections drop. DNS changes. SSL certificates expire. Firewalls get updated. Each of these can silently disconnect your agent from the platforms it's supposed to be monitoring.</p>

                <h2 id="diy-approach">The DIY Approach: What It Actually Takes</h2>

                <p>Let's say you want to self-host an AI agent — using a framework like <a href="/blog/posts/what-is-openclaw/">OpenClaw</a> — and keep it running 24/7. Here's the realistic infrastructure you need:</p>

                <h3>The Server</h3>

                <p>You need a Linux server that's always on. Options include:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Home server / Raspberry Pi</strong> — Cheap, but your home internet goes down, power flickers, and you have no redundancy. Not suitable for anything production-critical.</li>
                    <li><strong>VPS (DigitalOcean, Hetzner, Linode)</strong> — $5-20/mo for a capable VM. Reasonable, but now you're managing a server.</li>
                    <li><strong>AWS/GCP/Azure</strong> — Overkill for a single agent, and the billing complexity alone will take hours to understand.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>The Process Manager</h3>

                <p>You can't just run <code>node agent.js</code> in a screen session. You need a process manager that restarts your agent when it crashes:</p>

<pre><code># Using systemd (Linux)
[Unit]
Description=My AI Agent
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=agent
WorkingDirectory=/opt/agent
ExecStart=/usr/bin/node agent.js
Restart=always
RestartSec=10
Environment=NODE_ENV=production

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target</code></pre>

                <p>Or with Docker and a restart policy:</p>

<pre><code># docker-compose.yml
version: '3.8'
services:
  agent:
    build: .
    restart: unless-stopped
    volumes:
      - agent-data:/data
    environment:
      - ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=${ANTHROPIC_API_KEY}
      - TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=${TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN}
volumes:
  agent-data:</code></pre>

                <p>This handles basic crash recovery, but it doesn't tell you <em>when</em> your agent crashed, <em>why</em> it crashed, or whether the restart actually worked.</p>

                <h2 id="monitoring">Monitoring and Crash Recovery</h2>

                <p>The process manager restarts your agent, but you still need to know when things go wrong. A few approaches:</p>

                <h3>Health Checks</h3>

                <p>Add an HTTP endpoint to your agent that returns 200 when healthy. Then use an uptime monitor (UptimeRobot, Healthchecks.io) to ping it every minute. If it stops responding, you get an alert.</p>

<pre><code>// Simple health check endpoint
const http = require('http');
http.createServer((req, res) => {
  if (req.url === '/health') {
    const isHealthy = agent.isConnected() && agent.lastHeartbeat > Date.now() - 60000;
    res.writeHead(isHealthy ? 200 : 503);
    res.end(isHealthy ? 'ok' : 'unhealthy');
  }
}).listen(8080);</code></pre>

                <h3>Log Aggregation</h3>

                <p>When your agent crashes at 3 AM and the auto-restart fails, you need to know why. Ship logs to a service like Grafana Loki, or at minimum, write them to a file with proper rotation:</p>

<pre><code># Using journalctl with systemd
journalctl -u my-agent -f --since "1 hour ago"

# Or redirect to file with logrotate
ExecStart=/usr/bin/node agent.js >> /var/log/agent/agent.log 2>&1</code></pre>

                <h3>Alerting</h3>

                <p>Monitoring without alerting is just logging. You need to get paged when your agent goes down. This means setting up PagerDuty, OpsGenie, or at minimum a webhook to your phone. Now you're on-call for your AI agent. Welcome to DevOps.</p>

                <h2 id="persistent-storage">Persistent Storage and State Management</h2>

                <p>The most overlooked aspect of running agents 24/7 is state persistence. When your agent restarts (and it <em>will</em> restart), it needs to pick up where it left off.</p>

                <h3>What Needs to Persist</h3>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Conversation history</strong> — So your agent remembers what it was discussing with each user</li>
                    <li><strong>Task queue</strong> — Pending actions that were scheduled but not yet executed</li>
                    <li><strong>Working files</strong> — Documents, data files, or code the agent was working with</li>
                    <li><strong>Configuration state</strong> — User preferences, learned patterns, cached data</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Storage Options</h3>

                <p>For a single agent, SQLite is often the right call — it's a single file, zero configuration, and handles concurrent reads well. For multi-agent deployments, PostgreSQL is the standard choice.</p>

<pre><code>// Minimal persistence with SQLite
const db = new Database('/data/agent-state.db');
db.exec(`
  CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS conversations (
    id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id TEXT,
    messages TEXT,
    updated_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
  )
`);

// Save state before shutdown
process.on('SIGTERM', () => {
  agent.saveState(db);
  db.close();
  process.exit(0);
});</code></pre>

                <p>The key insight is that persistence needs to be <strong>automatic and continuous</strong>, not just on shutdown. If your agent crashes (SIGKILL, OOM), graceful shutdown handlers don't fire. You need periodic state snapshots.</p>

                <h2 id="multi-channel">Multi-Channel Connectivity</h2>

                <p>Modern AI agents don't just live in one chat app. They need to be reachable on Telegram, Discord, Slack, WhatsApp, email, and potentially SMS. Each channel has its own connection model:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Telegram</strong> — Long-polling or webhooks. Webhooks require HTTPS with a valid certificate.</li>
                    <li><strong>Discord</strong> — WebSocket gateway connection that needs regular heartbeats.</li>
                    <li><strong>Slack</strong> — Socket Mode or webhooks via an app manifest.</li>
                    <li><strong>WhatsApp</strong> — Business API requires a registered phone number and webhook endpoint.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Each channel is another connection to maintain, another failure mode to handle, another set of API quirks to manage. Running a multi-channel agent reliably is significantly harder than running a single-channel one.</p>

                <h2 id="managed-approach">The Managed Approach: Letting Someone Else Worry</h2>

                <p>Everything described above — the server, process manager, monitoring, alerting, persistent storage, multi-channel connectivity — is infrastructure work. It's valuable, but it's not why you built your AI agent.</p>

                <p>This is exactly the problem that <strong>managed AI agent hosting</strong> solves. Services like <a href="https://launchagent.dev">LaunchAgent</a> handle the entire operational stack:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Automatic crash recovery</strong> — Your agent restarts within seconds, not minutes</li>
                    <li><strong>24/7 monitoring</strong> — Health checks, log aggregation, and alerting built in</li>
                    <li><strong>Persistent storage</strong> — State survives restarts automatically</li>
                    <li><strong>Multi-channel support</strong> — Telegram, Discord, Slack, WhatsApp configured out of the box</li>
                    <li><strong>Automatic updates</strong> — Security patches and framework updates applied without downtime</li>
                </ul>

                <p>The tradeoff is straightforward: you pay $29/mo instead of spending 5-10 hours per month on infrastructure maintenance. If your time is worth more than $3-6/hour, the math is clear. (For a deeper analysis, read our <a href="/blog/posts/managed-vs-diy-ai-agents/">Managed vs DIY comparison</a>.)</p>

                <p>LaunchAgent is built specifically for <a href="/blog/posts/what-is-openclaw/">OpenClaw</a> agents, which means the hosting is optimized for the framework's specific requirements — the gateway daemon, the channel plugins, the tool system, and the agent lifecycle. It's not generic container hosting; it's purpose-built agent infrastructure.</p>

                <h2 id="checklist">Your 24/7 Agent Readiness Checklist</h2>

                <p>Whether you self-host or use a managed service, here's what you need for a production-grade 24/7 agent:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>☐ <strong>Process management</strong> — Auto-restart on crash with backoff</li>
                    <li>☐ <strong>Health monitoring</strong> — Know within 60 seconds when your agent is down</li>
                    <li>☐ <strong>Alerting</strong> — Get notified on your phone, not just in a log file</li>
                    <li>☐ <strong>Persistent storage</strong> — State survives restarts and crashes</li>
                    <li>☐ <strong>Log management</strong> — Searchable logs with at least 7 days of retention</li>
                    <li>☐ <strong>Graceful shutdown</strong> — Save state and close connections before exit</li>
                    <li>☐ <strong>Secret management</strong> — API keys not hardcoded, rotatable without redeployment</li>
                    <li>☐ <strong>Backup strategy</strong> — Can you restore your agent's state from yesterday?</li>
                    <li>☐ <strong>Update plan</strong> — How do you deploy new versions without downtime?</li>
                    <li>☐ <strong>Channel resilience</strong> — Reconnection logic for each messaging platform</li>
                </ul>

                <p>If going through this list fills you with dread, that's normal. Most of these items are solved problems — but they're solved problems that each take a few hours to implement properly. It adds up fast.</p>
