                <p>Every engineering team faces build-vs-buy decisions. Should we write our own auth system or use Auth0? Should we manage our own databases or use a managed service? These decisions have well-established frameworks.</p>

                <p>AI agent infrastructure is newer, and the calculus isn't as obvious. The agent frameworks are open source. The cloud compute is cheap. How hard can it be?</p>

                <p>The answer, as always, depends on context. This guide gives you a framework for making the decision — with real numbers, not hand-waving.</p>

                <h2 id="build-vs-buy">The Build vs Buy Question for AI Agents</h2>

                <p>When we talk about "DIY" vs "managed" AI agents, we need to separate two things:</p>

                <ol>
                    <li><strong>The agent itself</strong> — Its personality, tools, capabilities, and behavior. This is <em>your</em> product, and you should always control it regardless of hosting approach.</li>
                    <li><strong>The infrastructure</strong> — Servers, process management, monitoring, networking, persistence, and operational maintenance. This is plumbing.</li>
                </ol>

                <p>The build vs buy decision is about #2. Nobody is suggesting you shouldn't build your own agent. The question is: should you also build and maintain the infrastructure it runs on?</p>

                <p>This is the same question as "should we run our own PostgreSQL cluster or use RDS?" The database schema is yours either way. You're just deciding who manages the servers.</p>

                <h2 id="true-cost-diy">The True Cost of DIY AI Agent Infrastructure</h2>

                <p>Let's break down the real costs of running your own AI agent infrastructure. We'll use a single <a href="/blog/posts/what-is-openclaw/">OpenClaw</a> agent as the baseline, but this applies to any agent framework.</p>

                <p>Compare this to managed hosting at $29/mo: <strong>$348/year</strong>. Even at the lowest professional rate ($50/hr), DIY costs <strong>10x more</strong> in the first year.</p>

                <p>The hobby rate ($0/hr) is the only scenario where DIY is cheaper — and that's only true if you genuinely don't value your time, which is fine for a learning project.</p>

                <h2 id="hidden-costs">Hidden Costs Most Teams Miss</h2>

                <p>The table above covers the obvious costs. Here are the ones that don't show up in estimates but hit your budget hard:</p>

                <h3>1. Opportunity Cost</h3>

                <p>Every hour spent on infrastructure is an hour <em>not</em> spent on improving your agent, finding customers, or building your product. For a startup, the opportunity cost of the founder spending 5 hours/month on server maintenance is enormous.</p>

                <p>Ask yourself: "If I had 5 extra hours this month, what would I build?" If the answer is more valuable than $29, the math is settled.</p>

                <h3>2. Context Switching Cost</h3>

                <p>Infrastructure work is deeply disruptive. When your agent's monitoring alert fires at 2 PM, you don't just lose the 30 minutes to fix it — you lose the focus and momentum on whatever you were working on. Research suggests context switches cost 15-25 minutes of recovery time beyond the interruption itself.</p>

                <h3>3. Incident Stress</h3>

                <p>This one's hard to quantify but very real. When your agent goes down and a customer messages you asking what happened, you feel responsible. That stress compounds over time. When someone else handles the infrastructure and guarantees uptime, that weight is off your shoulders.</p>

                <h3>4. Knowledge Concentration Risk</h3>

                <p>If one person on your team sets up the infrastructure, only that person knows how it works. When they're on vacation, sick, or leave the company, you have a knowledge silo. Managed services eliminate this risk entirely.</p>

                <h3>5. Security Liability</h3>

                <p>If your self-hosted server gets compromised because you missed an OS security patch, that's your liability. Managed services shift that responsibility (and liability) to the provider.</p>

                <h2 id="cost-formula">The Real Cost Formula</h2>

                <p>Here's the formula we recommend for making this decision:</p>

                <blockquote>
                    <strong>DIY Annual Cost</strong> = Server Cost + (Monthly Hours × Hourly Rate × 12) + (Incident Hours × Hourly Rate × 12) + Opportunity Cost
                </blockquote>

                <blockquote>
                    <strong>Managed Annual Cost</strong> = Monthly Fee × 12
                </blockquote>

                <p>If you're honest about the hours (most people underestimate by 2-3x until they've done it for six months), managed wins for anyone whose time has meaningful economic value.</p>

                <h3>The Breakeven Point</h3>

                <p>At what hourly rate does DIY become more expensive than $29/mo managed hosting?</p>

<pre><code>Monthly DIY cost = $15 (VPS) + (5 hours × hourly_rate)
Monthly managed cost = $29

Breakeven: $15 + 5x = $29
5x = $14
x = $2.80/hr

If your time is worth more than $2.80/hr,
managed hosting is cheaper.</code></pre>

                <p>That breakeven point — <strong>$2.80/hour</strong> — is deliberately absurd. It illustrates the point: the server cost is irrelevant. The time cost is everything.</p>

                <p>Despite the cost analysis, there are legitimate reasons to self-host:</p>

                <h3>1. Learning and Education</h3>

                <p>You want to understand how AI agents work at the infrastructure level. The process of setting up servers, configuring process managers, building monitoring — it teaches you skills that have broad applicability. The "cost" is actually tuition.</p>

                <h3>2. Regulatory Requirements</h3>

                <p>Your industry requires data to stay on infrastructure you directly control, in specific geographic regions, with specific audit trails. Healthcare (HIPAA), finance (SOC2), and government agencies often have these requirements.</p>

                <h3>3. Deep Customization</h3>

                <p>You're modifying OpenClaw's core, building custom system-level tools, or need OS-level access for specialized functionality. Managed platforms can't offer the same level of customization as a server you own.</p>

                <h3>4. Existing DevOps Infrastructure</h3>

                <p>You already have a DevOps team, Kubernetes cluster, monitoring stack, and CI/CD pipeline. Adding one more service to your existing infrastructure has near-zero marginal cost.</p>

                <h3>5. Scale Economics</h3>

                <p>At very high scale (dozens or hundreds of agents), the economics may favor self-hosting. At that point, you're effectively building your own managed platform internally — and the fixed costs are spread across many agents.</p>

                <h2 id="when-managed">When Managed Makes Sense</h2>

                <h3>1. Speed to Market</h3>

                <p>You need your agent live now, not next weekend. Managed hosting gets you from zero to production in 20 minutes. For businesses where the agent is generating value (handling customer requests, automating tasks), every day of delay is lost revenue.</p>

                <h3>2. Solo Founders and Small Teams</h3>

                <p>You wear many hats and infrastructure management isn't where you want to spend your limited time. Every hour counts when you're building a company.</p>

                <h3>3. Non-Technical Users</h3>

                <p>You're a business owner who wants an AI agent without learning Linux system administration. This is a completely valid use case — not everyone needs to understand <code>systemd</code> to benefit from AI agents.</p>

                <h3>4. Production Reliability Requirements</h3>

                <p>Your agent serves customers. Downtime means lost business. A managed service with <a href="/blog/posts/how-to-run-ai-agents-247/">24/7 monitoring</a> and automatic recovery provides reliability that's expensive to build yourself.</p>

                <h3>5. Focus on Agent Quality</h3>

                <p>You'd rather spend your time making your agent smarter, more capable, and more useful — rather than keeping it alive. This is the highest-leverage use of your time.</p>

                <h2 id="decision-framework">The Decision Framework</h2>

                <p>Answer these five questions to decide:</p>

                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Is this for learning or production?</strong><br>
                    Learning → DIY. Production → Lean toward managed.</li>

                    <li><strong>What's your effective hourly rate?</strong><br>
                    If > $3/hr (which is everyone), the time cost of DIY exceeds $29/mo.</li>

                    <li><strong>Do you have existing DevOps infrastructure?</strong><br>
                    Yes → DIY is marginal cost. No → DIY requires building from scratch.</li>

                    <li><strong>Are there regulatory requirements for data location?</strong><br>
                    Yes → DIY gives you control. No → Either option works.</li>

                    <li><strong>What happens if your agent goes down for 4 hours?</strong><br>
                    Nothing important → DIY is fine. Customer impact → Managed is safer.</li>
                </ol>

                <p>If you answered "production," "high," "no," "no," and "customer impact" — managed hosting is the clear choice.</p>

                <h2 id="hybrid">The Hybrid Approach</h2>

                <p>Here's the approach we actually recommend for most teams:</p>

                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Start with managed hosting</strong> — Get your agent live fast. Validate that it provides value. Use the free trial to test everything.</li>
                    <li><strong>Iterate on the agent</strong> — Spend your time making the agent better, not managing servers.</li>
                    <li><strong>Evaluate after 3 months</strong> — Now you know your real requirements. Are you happy with managed? Stay. Need more control? You can self-host now with a clear understanding of what's needed.</li>
                    <li><strong>Migrate if necessary</strong> — Because OpenClaw is open source, migrating from managed to self-hosted is straightforward. Export your configuration, set up your server, import. No vendor lock-in.</li>
                </ol>

                <p>This approach minimizes risk: you get to production fast, and you retain the option to change strategies later. The worst outcome — spending weeks on infrastructure only to discover the agent concept doesn't work — is eliminated.</p>

                <p>LaunchAgent is built on this philosophy. We want you to succeed with AI agents. If that means you eventually outgrow managed hosting and self-host, great — OpenClaw is still open source and your agent is still yours.</p>
